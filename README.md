# CubesWithinCubes
Procedurally generated 3D art demo with [@babyshoes](https://github.com/babyshoes) !

The gist: tries to stick as many cubes into a parent cube as it can. Then recursively tries to stick more cubes in those cubes.
Prone to crash ~5 levels deep

Also some cool shader effects going on and a nice little character controller

* screenshots/vid coming soon *

Made in Unity
